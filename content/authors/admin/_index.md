I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, where I work under the supervision of Dr. William Evans. My research interests encompass Algorithms, Game Theory, and Blockchains. My research goal is to design system models that incorporate provably efficient algorithms, incentivize self-interested agents to behave constructively, and decentralize power. I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from the Sharif University of Technology and my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia.
