I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC), supervised by Dr. William Evans. My Ph.D. research focuses on optimization with explorable uncertainty, and I am expected to graduate in August 2025. With a solid background in both the theory and practice of computer science, I am interested in algorithms, optimization, distributed systems, blockchains, machine learning, and software engineering.
